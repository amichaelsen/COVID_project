Goals: initial exploration of COVID datasets 1 and 2. maybe decide on some which to explore and some preliminary questions to ask. 

Converted cumulative death data for CA covid daily cases into delta (daily counts) and then applied a rolling average to plot the smoothed daily death counts for CA. Created method for making future rolling averages 

Questions: 

Create a model to predict covid cases (by...state? zip? what level of detail?)

explore other datasets and look at causes of death. Maybe make a model for predicting death or type of death based on features?
